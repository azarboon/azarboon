- Driven by my interests, I have analyzed and written commentaries on AWS Lambda and Azure Functions over the years, with my insights featured in a leading industry publication. My comparisons were highlighted in [Off-by-None](https://offbynone.io/)—one of the longest-running and most widely read AWS newsletters, curated by AWS Serverless Hero [Jeremy Daly](https://www.jeremydaly.com/)—in issues [#28](https://offbynone.io/issues/28/) and [#313](https://offbynone.io/issues/313/). Additionally, I was a featured guest on the Serverless Chats podcast (Episode [#103](https://www.serverlesschats.com/103/)), where I discussed key differences between the two technologies.

- I regularly contribute to Wikipedia on topics such as cloud computing, serverless computing, AWS Lambda, and software architecture. My focus is on improving the quality of these pages to make best practices more accessible, particularly for newcomers seeking to learn efficiently. You can find my [Wikipedia contributions here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Azarboon).
- Designed and developed a cross-account CI/CD-based Serverless application [boilerplate](https://github.com/eficode/serverless-ops-boilerplate).
